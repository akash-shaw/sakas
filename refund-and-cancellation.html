        <h1>Refund and Cancellation Policy</h1>
        <p>Last updated: June 24, 2024</p>

        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
            At Sakas Strategies, we are dedicated to delivering top-quality web
            development services tailored to the unique needs of our clients. Our
            policy aims to be transparent, fair, and aligned with our commitment to
            customer satisfaction while maintaining the integrity of our business
            operations.
        </p>

        <h2>1. Project Workflow</h2>
        <h3>1.1 Initial Consultation</h3>
        <p>
            We begin with an in-depth consultation to understand the client’s
            requirements and objectives. This is a critical phase where all project
            specifications are agreed upon.
        </p>

        <h3>1.2 Prototype Development</h3>
        <p>
            Based on the consultation, we develop a basic prototype of the website.
            The prototype is presented to the client through online meeting
            platforms or shared as video walkthroughs. Clients are encouraged to
            provide feedback, and necessary revisions are made to align the
            prototype with their expectations.
        </p>

        <h3>1.3 Final Development</h3>
        <p>
            After the prototype is approved, we proceed with the full development of
            the website.
        </p>

        <h3>1.4 Delivery</h3>
        <p>
            Upon completion, the final product is presented to the client. The
            client must settle the payment before the final code is delivered or
            deployed. Payment methods accepted: UPI and Net Banking.
        </p>

        <h2>2. Refund Policy</h2>
        <h3>2.1 Prototype Approval Stage</h3>
        <p>
            No payment is required during the prototype development and revision
            stage. Clients can request changes to the prototype without incurring
            any charges until they approve it for full development.
        </p>

        <h3>2.2 Post-Prototype Approval</h3>
        <p>
            Once the client approves the prototype and we proceed to the final
            development, the following terms apply:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Non-refundable Payment</strong>: Payments made after the final
                product is delivered (code shared or deployed) are non-refundable.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Refund Exclusion</strong>: Given the custom nature of web
                development, once the final code has been delivered or deployed,
                refunds are not possible. This policy ensures that the extensive
                resources and time invested in each project are adequately
                compensated.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Cancellation Policy</h2>
        <h3>3.1 Pre-Prototype Approval</h3>
        <p>
            Clients may cancel the project without any financial obligation during
            the prototype development and revision stages.
        </p>

        <h3>3.2 Post-Prototype Approval</h3>
        <p>
            If a client wishes to cancel the project after approving the prototype
            but before the final product is delivered, they must notify us in
            writing via email or other official communication channels.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Refund Eligibility</strong>: Any payments made after prototype
            approval but before final delivery are eligible for a refund, excluding
            any specific costs incurred for services rendered up to the point of
            cancellation (e.g., special third-party services, specific development
            modules that were initiated post-prototype approval).
        </p>
